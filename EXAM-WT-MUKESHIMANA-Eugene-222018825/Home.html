<h1>2. Rei</h1>
When it comes to e-commerce websites, fast load times are critical for driving sales. One of the<br> biggest factors that can slow down a site is the use of excessive imagery.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.rei.com/"> Rei’s website </a>has a remarkably fast load time of just 1.07 seconds, which is a significant achievement<br> in the e-commerce world.

<br> <br><br>
By keeping their load time so low, Rei has ensured that potential customers can quickly and easily<br> access their products and make purchases<br><br>
